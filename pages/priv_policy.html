                </p>

                <p><strong>General information on the legal basis for data processing on this website</strong><br>
                    If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6
                    para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, insofar as special categories of data are
                    processed in accordance with Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR. In the event of express consent to the transfer
                    of personal data to third countries, data processing is also carried out on the basis of Art. 49
                    para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information in
                    your end device (e.g. via device fingerprinting), the data processing is also carried out on the
                    basis of Section 25 (1) of the GDPR. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required
                    to fulfill the contract or to carry out pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis
                    of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if this is necessary to fulfill a

                <p><strong>Recipients of personal data</strong><br>
                    As part of our business activities, we work together with various external bodies. In some cases,
                    it is also necessary to transfer personal data to these external bodies. We only pass on personal
                    data to external bodies if this is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally
                    obliged to do so (e.g. passing on data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the
                    transfer in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR or if another legal basis permits the transfer
                    of data. When using processors, we only pass on our customer's; personal data on the basis of a
                    valid contract for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement
                    is concluded.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Withdrawal of your consent to data processing</strong><br>
                    Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can withdraw
                    your consent at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation
                    remains unaffected by the revocation.
                </p>

                    RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME ON
                    GROUNDS RELATING TO YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO
                    PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH
                    PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE
                    WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA CONCERNED UNLESS WE CAN
                    DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH

                    IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA ARE PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU
                    HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA

                    YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR
                    THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 2

                <p><strong>Right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority</strong><br>
                    In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a

                    place if it is technically feasible.
                </p>

                            processing of your personal data be restricted.

                        <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense or

                            your personal data.
                        </li>

                    Cookies have various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary, as certain website
                    functions would not work without them (e.g. the shopping cart function or the display of
                    videos). Other cookies can be used to evaluate user behavior or for advertising purposes.<br>

                    para. 1 lit. f GDPR, unless another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a legitimate
                    interest in the storage of necessary cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision
                    of its services. If consent to the storage of cookies and comparable recognition technologies has

                    This data is processed on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR if your request is related to the

                <p><strong>Facebook</strong><br>
                    Elements of the social network Facebook are integrated on this website. The provider of this
                    service is Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, Ireland. However,
                    according to Facebook, the data collected is also transferred to the USA and other third
                    countries.<br>
                    You can find an overview of the Facebook social media elements here:
                    https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/?locale=de_DE.<br>
                    When the social media element is active, a direct connection is established between your end
                    device and the Facebook server. Facebook receives the information that you have visited this
                    website with your IP address. If you click on the Facebook “Like” button while you are logged
                    into your Facebook account, you can link the content of this website to your Facebook profile.
                    This allows Facebook to associate your visit to this website with your user account. We would
                    like to point out that, as the provider of the pages, we have no knowledge of the content of the
                    transmitted data or its use by Facebook. Further information on this can be found in Facebook's

                    If personal data is collected on our website with the help of the tool described here and

                    Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland are jointly responsible for this data processing (Art. 26
                    GDPR). The joint responsibility is limited exclusively to the collection of the data and its transfer
                    to Facebook. The processing carried out by Facebook after forwarding is not part of the joint
                    responsibility. The obligations incumbent on us jointly have been set out in an agreement on
                    joint processing. The text of the agreement can be found at:<br>
                    https://www.facebook.com/legal/controller_addendum. According to this agreement, we are
                    responsible for providing the data protection information when using the Facebook tool and for
                    the secure implementation of the tool on our website in accordance with data protection law.
                    Facebook is responsible for the data security of Facebook products.

                    You can assert data subject rights (e.g. requests for information) regarding the data processed by
                    Facebook directly with Facebook. If you assert your data subject rights with us, we are obliged to
                    forward them to Facebook.<br>
                    The data transfer to the USA is based on the standard contractual clauses of the EU

                    When the social media element is active, a direct connection is established between your device

                    obtained, the service is used on the basis of our legitimate interest in the widest possible
                    visibility in social media.<br>
                    Insofar as personal data is collected on our website using the tool described here and forwarded

                    to Facebook or Instagram. The processing carried out by Facebook or Instagram after
                    forwarding is not part of the joint responsibility. The obligations incumbent on us jointly have

                    When you visit one of our websites on which YouTube is integrated, a connection to the

                    If you are logged into your YouTube account, you enable YouTube to assign your surfing

                    account.<br>
                    The use of YouTube is in the interest of an appealing presentation of our online offers. This
                    constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. If a

                    of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 TTDSG, insofar as the consent includes the storage
