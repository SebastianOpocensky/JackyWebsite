                <h2><strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</strong></h2>

                <h1><strong>8. Assumption of Risk</strong></h1>
                <p>I acknowledge that I have voluntarily enrolled to participate in this Retreat. In
                consideration of The Host allowing me to participate, I agree to this release of claims,
                waiver of liability and assumption of risks. On behalf of myself, my heirs, executors,
                successors, administrators and any other person who may have an interest at common
                law or by operation of statute, I hereby waive any and all claims I or such parties may
                have now or in the future. I release from liability The Host and any teachers, employees,

                guides, agents or representatives (“the releasees”) for any personal injury, death,
                property damage or loss or any nature suffered by me as a result of participation in any
                activity on the Retreat. I release from liability The Host for any cause whatsoever
                including those arising out of, or in any way connected to or occasioned by the
                negligence of the releasees.
                </p>

                <h2><strong>PHYSICAL TRAINING RELEASE OF LIABILITY</strong></h2>

                <h1><strong>9. Express Assumption of Risk</strong></h1>
                <p>I, the undersigned, am aware that there are significant risks involved in physical
                training, including but not limited to, the physical training inherent to all Yoga &
                Breathwork exercise activities, and that my participation in any such physical training
                program carries with it the potential for death, injury, and/or property damage. The
                risks include, but are not limited to, falls which can result in serious injury or death;
                injury or death due to negligence on the part of myself, my training partner, or other
                people around me; injury or death due to improper use or failure of equipment; strains
                and sprains; those risks caused by terrain, facilities, temperature, weather, equipment,
                vehicular traffic, actions of other people including, but not limited to, participants,
                volunteers, spectators, coaches, and trainers and lack of hydration. These risks are not
                only inherent to physical training but are also present for volunteers and spectators. I
                am aware that any of these above mentioned risks may result in serious injury or death
                to myself and or my partner(s). I willingly assume full responsibility for the risks that I
                am exposing myself to and accept full responsibility for any injury or death that may
                result from participating, volunteering or watching in any physical training, including
                this yoga program. I realize that liability may arise from negligence or carelessness by
                the persons or entities being released, from dangerous or defective equipment or
                property owned, maintained or controlled by them or because of their possible liability
                without fault. I acknowledge that I have no physical impairments, injuries, or illnesses
                that will endanger me or others.

                I acknowledge that I am willingly participating in these activities and that I have
                assumed all risks as described above. In consideration for my being allowed to
                participate in the activities offered, I, the undersigned hereby release The Host, their
                principals, teachers, agents, employees, and volunteers from any and all liability, claims,
                demands, actions or rights of action, which are related to, arise out of, or are in any way
                connected with my participation in this activity, including those allegedly attributed to
                the negligent acts or omissions of the above mentioned parties. This agreement shall be
                binding upon me, my successors, representatives, heirs, executors, assigns, or
                transferees. If any portion of this agreement is held invalid, I agree that the remainder
                of the agreement shall remain in full legal force and effect. If I am signing on behalf of a

                minor child, I also give full permission for any person connected with the hosting
                organization to administer first aid deemed necessary, and in case of serious illness or
                injury, I give permission to call for medical and or surgical care for the child and to
                transport the child to a medical facility deemed necessary for the well being of the child.

                Indemnification: The participant recognizes that there is risk involved in the types of
                activities offered. Therefore, the participant accepts financial responsibility for any
                injury that the participant may cause either to him/herself or to any other participant
                due to his/her negligence. Should the above mentioned parties, or anyone acting on
                their behalf, be required to incur attorney's fees and costs to enforce this agreement, I
                agree to reimburse them for such fees and costs. I further agree to indemnify and hold
                harmless The Host and the hosting organization, their principals, agents, employees,
                and volunteers from liability for the injury or death of any person(s) and damage to
                property that may result from my negligent or intentional act or omission while
                participating in activities offered. This includes but is not limited to parks, recreational
                areas, playgrounds, areas adjacent to main building, and/or any area selected for
                training.
                </p>

                <h2><strong>MEDIA</strong></h2>

                <h1><strong>10. Permission for Capture and Use</strong></h1>
                <p>Media is defined as photography, video, written or verbal testimonial, or any other form
                of capturing likeness. For valuable consideration received, I grant to The Host the
                absolute and irrevocable right and unrestricted permission concerning any captured
                media that she/he has taken or may take of me or in which I may be included with
                others, to use, reuse, publish, and republish in whole or in part, individually or in
                connection with other material, in any and all publishing platforms now or hereafter
                known, including the Internet, and for any purpose whatsoever, specifically including
                illustration, promotion, art, editorial, advertising, and trade, without restriction as to
                alteration; and to use my name in connection with any use if she/he so chooses. I release
                and discharge The Host from any and all claims and demands that may arise out of or in
                connection with the use of the media, including without limitation any and all claims for
                libel or violation of any right of publicity or privacy. This authorization and release shall
                also inure to the benefit of the heirs, legal representatives, licensees, and assigns of
                Photographer, Videographer, Interviewer, Editor, as well as the person(s) for whom
                he/she captured the media. I am a legally competent adult and have the right to contract
                in my own name. I have read this document and fully understand its contents. This
                release shall be binding upon me and my heirs, legal representatives, and assigns.
                </p>


                <h2><strong>WAIVER</strong></h2>

                <h1><strong>11. Release and Waiver of Liability</strong></h1>
                <p>I hereby agree that I, my assignees, heirs, distributees, guardians, and legal
                representatives will not make a claim against, sue or attach the property of The Host,
                their affiliates, teachers, employees, agents or volunteers or any of their affiliated
                organizations for injury or damage resulting from acts, howsoever caused, by any
                employee, agent, or contractor, or any of their affiliated organizations, as a result of my
                participation in The Host's Retreats. I hereby release The Host, and any of their agents
                or affiliated organizations from all actions, claims or demands that I, my assigns, heirs,
                distributees, guardians, and legal representatives now have or may hereafter have for
                injury, damage, or death resulting from my participation in The Host's Retreats.
                I am medically, physically, emotionally and in all respects fit and able to participate in
                The Host's Retreats.

                I agree I will be fully and financially responsible for my own physical condition and well-
                being during the Retreat and will follow the safety precautions and instructions

                prescribed by The Host.
                I acknowledge that The Host may make suggestions from time to time that are intended
                to help me and my well-being. However, I take ultimate responsibility for my choices
                and realize that The Host is not licensed medical provider and that I must consult my
                doctor.
                If I experience pain or discomfort during the Retreat, I will modify The Host's
                instruction to suit my individual needs. I will not hold The Host responsible for any pain
                or discomfort I experience during or after the Retreat. I understand that the activities
                offered on this Retreat are not a substitute for medical care. I understand that The
                Host is not qualified to perform spinal or skeletal adjustments, diagnose, prescribe, or
                treat physical or mental illness.
                By agreeing to the terms outlined here and elsewhere on the The Host's website I hereby
                release and discharge my rights and claims for damages or liabilities that may occur as a
                result of participation on a The Host's Retreat.
